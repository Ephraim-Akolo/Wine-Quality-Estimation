about = '''[b] fixed acidity[/b]

The predominant fixed acids found in wines are tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic.  Their respective levels found in wine can vary greatly but in general one would expect to see 1,000 to 4,000 mg/L tartaric acid, 0 to 8,000 mg/L malic acid, 0 to 500 mg/L citric acid, and 500 to 2,000 mg/L succinic acid.  All of these acids originate in grapes with the exception of succinic acid, which is produced by yeast during the fermentation process.  Grapes also contain ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), but this is lost during fermentation.  It is also legal to add fumaric acid as a preservative.

[b] volatile acidity[/b]

Volatile acidity (VA) is a measure of the wine's volatile (or gaseous) acids. The primary volatile acid in wine is acetic acid, which is also the primary acid associated with the smell and taste of vinegar. However, commercial vinegars have a concentration of 3 to 9 percent acetic acid (30 to 90 grams per liter, g/L), which is 30 to 90 times the allowable levels in wine.

Volatile acidity concentration is regulated by the federal Tax and Trade Bureau, and allowable levels for various wine styles can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In general, per the CFR: "The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide, is 0.14 g/100 mL for red wine and 0.12 g/100 mL for white wines." This is equivalent to 1.4 and 1.2 g/L acetic acid for red and white wines, respectively.

[b] citric acid [/b]

Citric acid is often added to wines to increase acidity, complement a specific flavor or prevent ferric hazes. It can be added to finished wines to increase acidity and give a “fresh” flavor. The disadvantage of adding citric acid is its microbial instability. Since bacteria use citric acid in their metabolism, it may increase the growth of unwanted microbes. Often to increase acidity of wine, winemakers will add tartaric acid instead.

[b] residual sugar[/b]

Residual Sugar, or RS for short, refers to any natural grape sugars that are leftover after fermentation ceases (whether on purpose or not). The juice of wine grapes starts out intensely sweet, and fermentation uses up that sugar as the yeasts feast upon it.

[b] chlorides[/b]

The amount of chloride in wine is influenced by both the terroir and type of grape, and the importance of quantification lies in the fact that wine flavor is strongly impacted by this particular ion, which, in high concentration, gives the wine an undesirable salty taste and significantly decreases its market appeal. Quantification also helps determining wine origin and different grape varieties used in the wine, thus justifying the difference in wine regulations from country to country.

[b] free sulfur dioxide[/b]

SO2 that is present in wine but has not yet reacted is considered “free.” Free SO2 is what is still available to protect the wine. Be particularly attentive to the amount used , and this is the last addition that can be performed.

[b] total sulfur dioxide[/b]

Simply put, Total Sulfur Dioxide (TSO2) is the portion of SO2 that is free in the wine plus the portion that is bound to other chemicals in the wine such as aldehydes, pigments, or sugars. Simply put, Total Sulfur Dioxide (TSO2) is the portion of SO2 that is free in the wine plus the portion that is bound to other chemicals in the wine such as aldehydes, pigments, or sugars.

[b] density[/b]

The typical density or specific gravity of the must (the term we give to wine before we add or pitch the yeast) is generally between 1.080 and 1.090. This essentially means your wine is 8-9% more dense than water. One of the most important parameters in wine production is the sugar content of the grapes. Accurately determining this value is crucial to deciding when to harvest for the highest quality wine.

[b] pH[/b]

Typically, the pH level of a wine ranges from 3 to 4. Red wines with higher acidity are more likely to be a bright ruby color, as the lower pH gives them a red hue. Higher pH, less-acidic red wines can take on a blue or purple hue.

Acidity is an essential component of any wine's profile, and it greatly influences overall perception. “If the pH is higher, the wine will be softer and rounder, and if the pH is lower, it will feel more linear,” says Cadamatre.

[b] sulphates[/b]

Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and unwanted bacteria and yeasts. Without added sulfites, a 1961 Bordeaux would be considered trash vinegar rather than a treasure.
A well made dry red wine typically has about 50 mg/l sulfites. Wines with lower acidity need more sulfites than higher acidity wines. Wines with more color (i.e., red wines) tend to need less sulfites than clear wines (i.e., white wines).

[b] alcohol[/b]

Wine can have anywhere between 5% and 23% ABV. The average alcohol content of wine is about 12%. This amount varies depending on the variety of wine, as well as the winemaker and their desired ABV. Some wines within the same family can even see differences in the alcohol content due to the location of the vineyard and winery.

[b] quality[/b]
This is the target variable to be estimated (predicted). It is a numeric figure that shows the quality of the wine ranging from 0 being very poor to 10 being very good.
